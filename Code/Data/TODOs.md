TODOs:
	- Dockerfile
		- mount this folder in dockerfile
		- write python ticket to ride validation tests
		- write to sqlite (probably easiest to use python)
		- save sqlite database to host system (should be handled by mounting this folder)
		- close container (should happen on exit)
		- bash script to build docker container, run docker container
		- error/success status file
